#Learning Journal January 20, 2018
Today I:
1. got some more practise with GitHub including:
    * GitHub Pages and deploying my code
    * using branches and merging
    * setting up a repositary correctly _and the wrong way_
2. playing around with functions, I enjoyed working through those questions.
