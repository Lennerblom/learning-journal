1. From the code demo, I think a bunch of gaps got filled in what I was doing.  I'm happy to at least been doing some of the same/similar code but semi lost.  So hopefully it will clear up when I get back into it.
2. I wasn't able to get the canvas stuff to work before. I downloaded it and then didn't know what to do. But I see how to do it now.  thank you.
